abstract: This study explores the price drivers of Chinese Emissions Allowances (CEAs) in the early stage of China’s national carbon market. Using daily time series data from July 2021 to July 2023, we find limited influence from conventional drivers, including energy prices and economic factors. Instead, national power generation emerges as a significant driver. These are primarily due to the distinct institutional features of China’s national carbon market, notably its rate-based system and sectoral coverage. Moreover, the study uncovers cumulative abnormal volatility in CEA prices ranging from 12% to 20% around the end of the first compliance cycle, reflecting sentiments about the policy design and participants’ limited understanding about carbon trading. Our results extend previous literature regarding carbon pricing determinants by highlighting China’s unique carbon market design, comparing it with the western programs, and offering valuable insights for tailored market-based policies in developing countries.
