abstract: China's national emissions trading system(ETS) is an important policy innovation in China's energy and climate policies, m arking a significant shift from command-and-control instruments to market-based approaches.China's national ETS will play a key rol e in promoting carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. It will become the largest ETS globally once launched and greatly influence the future development of the global carbon pricing regime.The design of China's ETS needs to incorporate economic theory and interna tional experiences, but more importantly, it should fully consider China's current situation and develop a system with Chinese charact eristics. China's national ETS needs to be aligned with the country's macro-economic goals, including carbon peaking, carbon neutrali ty, and high-quality development. It needs to balance short-term goals and long-term targets and equity and efficiency in the proces s of its development step by step. In addition, it should be coordinated with the electricity market reform and stay compatible with ot her international carbon markets.At the initial phase, China's national ETS is a rate-based rather than a mass-based system. The alloca tion of allowances to firms in each sector is based on their actual output levels and corresponding benchmark emissions-output ratio,which should be an appropriate efficiency imrovement target for that sector. China's national ETS is essentially a multi-sector tradabl e performance standard(TPS) and will serve as a tax or subsidy for firms with different emissions intensities. China chooses the TPS ra ther than a fixed cap for three reasons: first, the TPS is more appropriate for economies with faster growth as the output level is more uncertain; second, it is more politically appealing,third, it could be better aligned with China's near-term emissions reduction target,which is based on emissions intensity. Therefore, China's national ETS has a flexible emissions cap associated with actual output levels of covered sectors, rather than a fixed cap. The cap is also determined by the choice of benchmarks, reflecting an idea of combining "bottom-up" and "top-down" in the cap-setting process. As China's electricity and heat sector is still in the process of market reform,carbon prices cannot be fully passed from producers to consumers. To incorporate consumers' emissions reduction responsibility and achieve their emissions reduction potential, China's ETS currently accounts for both direct emissions and indirect emissions associate d with electricity an heat consumed by regulated firms.At the time of writing, China's national ETS is ready for formal operation. Key measures on the cap setting, allowance allocation, permit trading, along with monitoring, reporting, and verification(MRV) mechanis m, have been formulated through a series of regulations and technical specifications. The permit registration system, permit trading s ystem, and settiement system are also completed. The first compliance cycle of China's national ETS has been officially started from 2021, covering the power generation sector as the first regulated industry, with 2225 power generators(or combined heat and power g enerators) covered During the 14 th Five-Year Plan period, China's national ETS should strive to cover all the eight key energy-intensiv e and emissions-intensive industries. It should set the cap and benchmarks following the "strctly controlling emissions increase" prin ciple to facilitate carbon peaking before 2030. During the 15 th Five-Year Plan period, sector and firm coverage of the national ETS sh ould be further expanded. The cap setting and benchmark would be determined following the "steadily decreasing emissions* princi ple. The proportion of permits for auction should gradually increase, promoting the role of the national ETS in achieving China's carb on peaking and carbon neutrality targets.
