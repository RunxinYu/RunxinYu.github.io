I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy, Tsinghua University. In Spring 2025, I was a Visiting Scholar at the California-China Climate Institute, University of California, Berkeley. My research interest focuses on energy and climate policy, environmental and resource economics, and price-based instruments, with a particular emphasis on emissions trading system (known as carbon markets). 
My work examines critical aspects of carbon market design—such as cap-setting, sectoral coverage, allowance allocation, and market stability—contributing to policy development through academic publications, public reports, and confidential briefs. I also investigate voluntary carbon markets (e.g., forestry offsets) and inclusive decarbonization mechanisms(e.g., personal carbon accounts). Moving forward, I aim to deepen insights into carbon pricing, policy co-benefits, energy and climate justice, and innovative climate solutions.
