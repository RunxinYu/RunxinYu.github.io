I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. Xiliang Zhang. My research interests include energy and climate policy, price-based instruments, environmental and resource economics, and the application of artificial intelligence in management sciences. I graduated from Sun Yat-sen University (https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) and received dual bachelor’s degrees in accounting from theInternational School of Business & Finance (https://isbf.sysu.edu.cn/).
